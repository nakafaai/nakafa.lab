# Affordable-Cure Candidate Promotion Gate

Date checked: 2026-05-30
Scope: research prioritization, not treatment advice

## Purpose

This gate connects the May 29 affordability gap matrix to candidate scoring.
It prevents the project from promoting a candidate just because it feels
hopeful or novel.

Current operational label:

`case001_affordable_cure_candidate_promotion_gate_ready`

## Promotion Test

A candidate can move upward only if all four questions have source-backed
answers:

| Question | Required answer |
| --- | --- |
| Which gap? | Cost, infrastructure, conditioning, monitoring, access, safety, fertility, or assay feasibility. |
| Which benchmark? | Closest curative benchmark and closest non-curative benchmark. |
| Which endpoint? | HbF, F-cells, hemoglobin, transfusion burden, chain balance, hemolysis, viability, iron burden, or safety. |
| What would falsify it? | A clear stop rule such as identity failure, no endpoint movement, hemolysis, toxicity, access failure, or benchmark-only status. |

## Current Lane Labels

| Lane | Current label | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Approved or late gene-cell therapy | `benchmark_only` | Defines curative biology and endpoint standards but does not solve access, center, conditioning, or cost gaps. |
| Hydroxyurea | `affordable_clinical_comparator` | Useful low-cost HbF comparator; not a cure claim and not case-specific. |
| Sirolimus, `PRKAB1`/autophagy, `T-BDMC`, resveratrol | `hold_for_endpoint_or_identity_gap` | Assay-only until identity, HbF, chain balance, hemolysis, viability, and safety endpoints are present. |
| Thalidomide class or melittin hazard lanes | `reject_hazard_or_unmeasured_claim` | Safety boundary blocks therapeutic promotion without a new safety-resolution package. |
| AND017, luspatercept, mitapivat | `benchmark_only` | Useful for transfusion-burden or red-cell-metabolism comparison, not cure. |

## Current Research Read

The 2026 source refresh sharpens the gate rather than changing the cure claim.
PubMed now includes a 2026 exa-cel cost-effectiveness model projecting favorable
US value, but the author affiliations require sponsor-affiliation caution.
CDA-AMC's TDT pharmacoeconomic review keeps uncertainty, acquisition cost, and
price-reduction dependency visible. ClinicalTrials.gov still shows close China
editing and non-editing benchmarks, including CS-101 phase 2, VGB-Ex01,
luspatercept plus thalidomide, and AND017.

Therefore, Nakafa Lab should not promote another weak candidate. It should
promote only a candidate that names the benchmark gap it can realistically
improve and the test that could reject it.

After a candidate passes this promotion test, use the
[minimum assay readiness gate](../assays/2026-05-31-minimum-assay-readiness-gate.md)
before lab quote or partner outreach.

## Islamic Motivation Boundary

Quran 13:17 supports disciplined attrition: benefit remains and foam is
discarded. Quran 55:7-9 supports measured claims. These are research-method
anchors, not biomedical evidence for any candidate.
